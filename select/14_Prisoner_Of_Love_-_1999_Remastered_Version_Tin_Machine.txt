Don't look back every day to save your life
I believe I've belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says, 'No, no-one but you,'
Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I, I, I was a victim of my own self-persecution
I'm a prisoner of love, but I'm coming up for air

Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glisters more fool you

I'm such a hungry man that I beg you
Over and over and over and over
I mi-mi-mi, I might take any highway
To be there with you

Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love, I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square

Like a sermon on blues guitar
Love walked into town. I was drowning so slowly
Wouldn't step in front of your shadow
I'm a prisoner of love, but I'm coming up for air

Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you

I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you, yeah, even deceive you
I'm so afraid for you that
I'll break any thug who maps out your passage to ruin

Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love, I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square

Take care, take care
I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square

Just stay square
Stay out of the shooting gallery
Just stay square
I've seen the best minds of my generation
Lay down in cemetary and crematory
Just stay square
Just stay square, just stay square
Don't look back, beautiful soul
Don't look back, beautiful soul
