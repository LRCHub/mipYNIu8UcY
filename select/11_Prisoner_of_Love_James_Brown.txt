Alone from night to night, you'll find me
Too weak to break these chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
You're the judge, I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape, but it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
What's the good of my caring
For someone who's sharing those arms
But not with me?
