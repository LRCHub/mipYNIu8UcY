Don't look back
Whatever it takes to save your life
I've believed I belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says no, no one but you
Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I was a victim of my own self-persecution
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air
Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
I'm such a hungry man that I beg you over
And over and over and over
I might take any highway to be there with you
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love, I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Like a sermon on blues guitar
Love walked into town
I was drowning so slowly
One step in front of your shadow
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air
Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you, yeah, even deceive you
I'm so afraid for you that
I'll break any thug who maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love, I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Take care, take care
I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Just stay square
Stay out of this [Incomprehensible] gallery
Just stay square
I've seen the best man's of my generation
Laid down in cemetery, a crematory
Just stay calm
Just stay square
Just stay square
Don't look back
[Incomprehensible]
Don't look back
